# Setup

If you want to run the tests for this lesson on your machine, you'll have to do the following (yes, it's cumbersome, but that's just python in a nutshell):

```bash
# make sure you're in mini-lessons/testing/ first
python -m venv venv # python3 for unix-based systems
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Essentially, this creates a virtual environment to install packages into so you don't have to install packages globally.

# Setting Up Tests

-   Pick a library
-   Name things correctly

# Writing Tests
