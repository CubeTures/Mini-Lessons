# Mini-Lessons

A group of small lessons on various programming topics in various programming languages, taught through stories. The goal of these lessons is to help you figure out what you don't know, as when "you don't know what you don't know," it can be hard knowing where to start. These lessons serve as a mere introduction; these topics all have incredible depth and deserve their own semester-long classes. But, again, that is not the point of this. These lessons are only to help you figure out what the topic is like and give a brief overview of the most important talking points. If any topic peaks your interest, please pursue it deeper! My goal is nothing more than to inspire others to create.
